## Calculate the 'Synthetic Galaxy Distance' between two galaxy datsets.

This code calculates the 'Synthetic Galaxy Distance' (SGD) described in
'Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative models'.

The metric is the sum of Wasserstein-1 distances between emergent physical
galaxy properties from two given galaxy postage stamp observation datasets.
Here we compare size and flux distributions.

The SGD returns a single number, where a lower value denotes a closer
match between two datasets. When combined with the [Fr√©chet Inception
Distance](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) for visual and
morphological similarity, we gain a good overview of the similarity
between two large galaxy photometry datasets.
